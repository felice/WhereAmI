{"google":"","body":"# WhereAmI\r\nA quick command line tool to get your geographic coordinates using the OS X [CoreLocation][]) framework.\r\n\r\nDownload a zip with the latest version [here][download link].\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nOpen with Finder to execute, or in the terminal. If it can determine a location, it will output longitude, latitude, accuracy in meters and the time the location was found. WhereAmI tries to get a recent location, and will not display one if it is more than a minute old (to avoid inaccurate results from CoreLocation's cached data). If it cannot get location data, it will quit and print an error message.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nThis is a quick and dirty example. I make no guarantees or warranties as to its accuracy, stability or compatibility (it should work with 10.7 and 10.8, but I have only tested it on 10.7). Feel free to do with it as you wish.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n### 1.02\r\n - Fixed missing `@autoreleasepool`. Shouldn't be any practical changes, but it's good form.\r\n\r\n### 1.01\r\n- WhereAmI will now check if Wi-Fi is not enabled and tell the user such if it can't get location data.\r\n\r\n[corelocation]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoreLocation\r\n[download link]: https://github.com/downloads/robmathers/WhereAmI/whereami-1.02.zip","name":"WhereAmI","tagline":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
